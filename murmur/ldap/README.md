Murmur LDAP auth
================

Murmur has no native support for LDAP authentication, but there is a third-party
repository with scripts for pluggable auth backends.

The files in this folder are taken from that repository at commit f6e3f1e

The source repository is [here](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-scripts)
